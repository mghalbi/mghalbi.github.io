## Whoops! Could not find that page.

Hi there, I recently started my personal site and may have broken
a lot of links inadvertently.

If you don't mind, please <a href="https://github.com/filippobuletto/filippobuletto.github.io/issues/new">log an issue</a> with the URL you were trying to reach and where you found the URL. Thanks!

```java
Optional.ofNullable(Page.get("{{ site.url }}"))
  .orElseThrow(PageNotFoundException::new);
```

Perhaps you can try searching for it below.

<script type="text/javascript">
  var GOOG_FIXURL_LANG = 'en';
  var GOOG_FIXURL_SITE = '{{ site.url }}'
</script>
<script type="text/javascript"
  src="//linkhelp.clients.google.com/tbproxy/lh/wm/fixurl.js">
</script>
